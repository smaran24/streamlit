# streamlit
This repo explains about streamlit and its different features. It has end to end code to setup and develop web applications using streamlit, helpful for data scientist and analyts.

**Streamlit** is an open-source Python library designed to simplify the process of creating and sharing data apps with just a few lines of code. It allows data scientists and analysts to convert Python scripts into interactive web applications quickly, without requiring extensive web development knowledge.

### Key Features of Streamlit:
- **Simplicity:** Streamlit enables users to build data applications using only Python. There is no need for HTML, CSS, or JavaScript.
- **Widgets:** Provides a range of interactive widgets like sliders, checkboxes, and select boxes to control data and visualize changes in real time.
- **Dynamic Visualization:** Automatically re-runs the Python script and updates visualizations every time a user interacts with the widgets.
- **Seamless Integration:** Works well with popular data science libraries like NumPy, pandas, Matplotlib, Plotly, and others.
- **Custom Layouts:** Allows you to arrange the app's layout using columns, tabs, and expandable containers.
- **Easy Deployment:** Offers simple deployment via sharing tools like Streamlit Community Cloud or other cloud platforms.

### How Streamlit Helps in Data Science:
- **Prototyping and Experimentation:** Streamlit is excellent for rapid prototyping. You can quickly build an interactive app to visualize different models or datasets, speeding up the experimentation process.
- **Data Exploration and Analysis:** Widgets like sliders, filters, and buttons can be used to create interactive dashboards. They make it easier to explore, filter, and analyze data to derive insights.
- **Model Evaluation and Tuning:** Streamlit apps can visualize different evaluation metrics for machine learning models. This helps in understanding performance trade-offs and tuning hyperparameters.
- **Collaboration and Sharing:** Streamlit simplifies sharing data analysis results or machine learning models with non-technical stakeholders. They can interact with the app to understand the data or results without needing to access the raw code.
- **Automation of Reporting:** Automating analysis reports through interactive dashboards reduces the repetitive workload for data scientists.
